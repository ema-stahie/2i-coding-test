# 2i-coding-test

“In a language of your choice, using all best practice principles you’re aware of, could you please provide code that 
iterates in multiples of A until X, then in multiples of A + 1 until 2X, then multiples of A + 2 until 3X. Please state 
any assumptions you’ve made.”

Assumptions:
* Input is a positive integer, received from the command line
* 0 is a multiple of any number
* The program is looking in the interval 0, X inclusive for multiples of A, in the interval X+1, 2\*X inclusive for 
multiples of A+1 and in the interval 2\*X+1, 3\*X inclusive for multiples of A+2
* The output is a single line with the values found following the assumptions above
